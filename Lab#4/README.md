# Topic: *Behavioral Design Patterns*
## Author: *Gaidau Mihai*
------
## Objectives:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Study and understand the Behavioral Design Patterns.__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about what communication between software entities might be involed in your system.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Create a new Project or add some additional functionalities using behavioral design patterns.__

## Theoretical background:
&ensp; &ensp; Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the interaction and communication between objects and classes. They provide a way to organize the behavior of objects in a way that is both flexible and reusable, while separating the responsibilities of objects from the specific implementation details. Behavioral design patterns address common problems encountered in object behavior, such as how to define interactions between objects, how to control the flow of messages between objects, or how to define algorithms and policies that can be reused across different objects and classes.

&ensp; &ensp; Some examples from this category of design patterns are :

   * Chain of Responsibility
   * Command
   * Interpreter
   * Iterator
   * Mediator
   * Observer
   * Strategy
   
## Main tasks :
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Creating a new project or extending your last one project, implement at least 1 behavioral design pattern in your project:__
  * The implemented design pattern should help to perform the tasks involved in your system.
  * The behavioral DPs can be integrated into you functionalities alongside the structural ones.
  * There should only be one client for the whole system.
  
&ensp; &ensp; __2. Keep your files grouped (into packages/directories) by their responsibilities (an example project structure):__
  * client;
  * domain;
  * utilities;
  * data(if applies);
  
&ensp; &ensp; __3. Document your work in a separate markdown file according to the requirements presented below (the structure can be extended of course):__
  * Topic of the laboratory work.
  * Author.
  * Introduction/Theory/Motivation.
  * Implementation & Explanation (you can include code snippets as well):
    * Indicate the location of the code snippet.
    * Emphasize the main idea and motivate the usage of the pattern.
  * Results/Screenshots/Conclusions;

## Evaluation :
&ensp; &ensp; __1. The project should be located in the same repository as the previous lab.__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. It is allowed to use libs, but only for facilities like:__
  * Text processing.
  * UI creation (if necessary).
  * Other libs that don't contain implemented DPs and which do not do smth that you can do yourself.

&ensp; &ensp; __3. The mark of the lab is based on the number of implemented Design Patterns.__

  * 1 impl - 8 grade.
  * 2 impl - 9 grade.
  * 3 impl - 10 grade.

&ensp; &ensp; __4. Submit the repository URL on ELSE.__

&ensp; &ensp; __5. The time limit for this assignment is 3 weeks.__

&ensp; &ensp; __6. If the repositories obey all the requirements there is no need to present the work personally.__

&ensp; &ensp; __7. After the deadline for each weak the max grade decreases by 1.__

&ensp; &ensp; __8. The laboratory works can be defended either online or at the university during the seminar.__
