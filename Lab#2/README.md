## Objectives:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Study and understand the Creational Design Patterns.__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. Choose a domain, define its main classes/models/entities and choose the appropriate instantiation mechanisms.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Use some creational design patterns for object instantiation in a sample project.__

## Some Theory:
&ensp; &ensp; Creational design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on the process of object creation. They provide a way to create objects in a flexible and controlled manner, while decoupling the client code from the specifics of object creation. Creational design patterns address common problems encountered in object creation, such as how to create objects with different initialization parameters, how to create objects based on certain conditions, or how to ensure that only a single instance of an object is created. There are several creational design patterns that have their own strengths and weaknesses. Each of it is best suited for solving specific problems related to object creation. By using creational design patterns, developers can improve the flexibility, maintainability, and scalability of their code.

&ensp; &ensp; Some examples of this kind of design patterns are:

   * Singleton
   * Builder
   * Prototype
   * Object Pooling
   * Factory Method
   * Abstract Factory
   
## Main tasks:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Choose an OO programming language and a suitable IDE or Editor (No frameworks/libs/engines allowed).__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. Select a domain area for the sample project.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Define the main involved classes and think about what instantiation mechanisms are needed.__

&ensp; &ensp; __4. Based on the previous point, implement at least 2 creational design patterns in your project.__

## Evaluation:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. The project should be located in a repository on a git hosting service (e.g. Github, Gitlab, BitBucket etc.):__

  * You only need to have one project
  * You can have separate modules that depend on each other
  * You should separate the project into modules / packages based on the responsibilities:
    * client
    * domain
      * factory
      * models

&ensp; &ensp; __2. It should contain an explanation in the form of a README file or a LaTeX report with the standard structure from the TEMPLATE.md file.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. The mark of the lab is based on the number of implemented Design Patterns.__

  * 2 impl - 8 grade.
  * 3 impl - 9 grade.
  * 4 impl - 10 grade.

&ensp; &ensp; __4. Submit the repository URL on ELSE.__

&ensp; &ensp; __5. The time limit for this assignment is 3 weeks.__

&ensp; &ensp; __6. If the repositories obey all the requirements there is no need to present the work personally.__

&ensp; &ensp; __7. After the deadline for each weak the max grade decreases by 1.__

&ensp; &ensp; __8. The laboratory works can be defended either online or at the university during the seminar.__
