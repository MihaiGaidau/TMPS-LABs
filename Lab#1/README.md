# Topic: *SOLID Principles*
## Author: *Gaidau Mihai*

## Objectives:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Study and understand the SOLID Principles.__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. Choose a domain, define its main classes/models/entities and choose the appropriate instantiation mechanisms.__

&ensp; &ensp;__3. Create a sample project that respects SOLID Principles.__

## Theory:
&ensp; &ensp; SOLID is a set of five object-oriented design principles intended to make software designs more maintainable, flexible, and easy to understand. The acronym stands for Single Responsibility Principle, Open-Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. Each principle addresses a specific aspect of software design, such as the organization of responsibilities, the handling of dependencies, and the design of interfaces. By following these principles, software developers can create more modular, testable, and reusable code that is easier to modify and extend over time. These principles are widely accepted and adopted in the software development community and can be applied to any object-oriented programming language.
   
## Main tasks:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Choose an OO programming language and a suitable IDE or Editor (No frameworks/libs/engines allowed).__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. Select a domain area for the sample project.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Define the main involved classes and think about what instantiation mechanisms are needed.__

&ensp; &ensp; __4. Respect SOLID Principles in your project.__

## Evaluation:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. The project should be located in a repository on a git hosting service (e.g. Github, Gitlab, BitBucket etc.):__

  * You only need to have one project
  * You can have separate modules that depend on each other
  * You should separate the project into modules / packages based on the responsibilities:
    * client
    * domain
      * factory
      * models

&ensp; &ensp; __2. It should contain an explanation in the form of a README file or a LaTeX report with the standard structure from the TEMPLATE.md file.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. The mark of the lab is based on the number of SOLID principles you respected.__

&ensp; &ensp; __4. Submit the repository URL on ELSE.__

&ensp; &ensp; __5. The time limit for this assignment is 1 week.__

&ensp; &ensp; __6. After the deadline for each weak the max grade decreases by 1.__

&ensp; &ensp; __7. The laboratory works can be defended either online or at the university during the seminar.__
